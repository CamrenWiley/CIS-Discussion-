# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

escape from Orbville

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A platform shooter following the remians of a past explorer

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

I want my project to be a semi complete. I want the game to have a menu screen that you can save data to and interact with. The game itself shoul dbe a platform shooter that has enemys and a jumping mechanic. I would love to make it so the user can interact with the enivornment and explore new areas. 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?
N/A
## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.
N/A

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.
### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

I will without expection create a video game with at least 2 levels with enemys that plays can shoot at. I will also create something I am proud of no matter what it end up looking like.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

To create a basic game with terrain and multilpe levels that take you to new areas not seen before. I to create scrren transitions and impliment sound effects for diffrent actions in the game. I will also impliment all the thing from a GOOD outcome.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I would like to create a video game with an array of different mobs you can kill. Something similar to the game Deadcells if you are familar. I want this game to have multiple levels with hidden areas the player can explore. I would also hope to include everthing mentioned previously.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

To begin this project I need to find a software to run and creat a game on. You've presented multiple great resources so ill have to take a look. They all seem to use a language that not phython so I may need to look at a few videos to understand how it works. I will aslso need to gather a few tutorial video to learn how to implement and bring my idea to life.
